Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the participants' ability to implement decision-making logic using the ternary operator in Java. The ternary operator (?:) allows concise conditional expressions that work as a shorthand for if-else-if statements. This document presents the tasks, Java code for the implementation, and a test case class to evaluate the use of the ternary operator.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, participants will be able to:

Use the ternary operator for conditional decisions.
Replace if-else-if statements with ternary operators for more compact and readable code.
Solve problems using ternary operators instead of traditional conditional structures.
Assessment Tasks
Task 1: Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
Write a program that checks whether a given integer is positive, negative, or zero using a ternary operator.

Example:

Input: 0
Output: "The number 0 is zero."
Task 2: Find the Smallest of Three Numbers
Write a program to find the smallest of three given integers using the ternary operator.

Example:

Input: a=10, b=5, c=15
Output: "The smallest number is: 5"
Task 3: Check if a Number is Divisible by 3, 5, or Both
Write a program to check whether a given integer is divisible by 3, 5, or both using the ternary operator.

Example:

Input: num=15
Output: "The number 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5."
Task 4: Grade Calculation Based on Marks
Write a program to assign grades to a student based on their marks using the ternary operator.

90 and above: Grade A
75 to 89: Grade B
50 to 74: Grade C
Below 50: Grade F
Example:

Input: marks=82
Output: "Grade: B"
Task 5: Check Leap Year
Write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not using the ternary operator.

Example:

Input: year=2024
Output: "The year 2024 is a leap year."
